# About me
Hello! I'm Tsendee, a physicist with a passion for unraveling the unknowns of ultrafast phenomena on atomic and molecular time scales. Beyond my scientific pursuits, I'm an enthusiastic photographer who finds beauty in capturing moments, and I absolutely love hitting the open road on my bicycle.

Feel free to explore my GitHub repositories and join me on my journey of discovery and creativity.
